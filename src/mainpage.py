    @section sec_intro   Introduction
                         ME 405 (Mechatronics) is the second-in-series mechatronics course at Cal Poly.
                         
                         This class was taught by Charlie Refvem over a 10-week period. We covered a spectrum of
                         topics â€“ firmware design in finite state machines, kinetic and kinematic analyses of
                         mechanical systems as they apply to mechatronics, and applications of electronics and controller desgin
                         in responsive systems.
                         
                         The project documented here is the source code for a multitasking scheme to control a pen plotter
                         robot. The robot can be controlled manual by a joystick, or an .hpgl file of a vectorized
                         drawing may be uploaded to draw on the plotter.

                         All source code and relevant files for this project can be found on Github: <a href="https://github.com/jarodlyles/jarodlyles.github.io">Jarod's GitHub</a>
